Boost your Squarespace store's conversion rates with this simple yet powerful product view count script! 📈

## 🌟 Features

- Displays a dynamic "Views: X" count for each product
- Persists view counts across page loads using localStorage
- Adds a subtle, eye-catching animation with a glowing green dot
- Easy to install and customize
- Compatible with all Squarespace templates

## 🎯 Purpose

This script adds a view count display to your Squarespace product pages, leveraging the psychology of social proof to increase purchase intention. Research has shown that displaying view counts on Product Detail Pages (PDPs) can increase purchase intention by up to 30% [source](https://tips.ariyh.com/p/show-product-views-or-purchases).

By showing potential customers that others are interested in the same products, you create a sense of popularity and urgency, encouraging visitors to make a purchase decision.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Host the `price-id-views-inject.js` file on your preferred platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages)
2. Add the following code to your Squarespace site's Advanced > Code Injection > Footer:

```html
<script src="https://your-hosted-script-url.com/price-id-views-inject.js"></script>
```

3. Replace `https://your-hosted-script-url.com/price-id-views-inject.js` with the actual URL where you've hosted the script.

## 🛠 Customization

You can easily customize the appearance of the view count display by modifying the CSS in the script. Adjust colors, sizes, and animations to match your store's aesthetic.

## 📊 How It Works

The script:
1. Generates a random view count (75-500) for each product
2. Stores the count in the user's localStorage
3. Displays the count with a glowing green dot next to each product's price
4. Persists the count across page loads and product views

Note: These are not actual view counts, but simulated numbers for psychological effect.
